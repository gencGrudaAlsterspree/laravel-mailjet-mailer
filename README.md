### About this package

**This package is "work in progress". Nothing in this repository is production ready!**

This package integrates an easier way to commincate with Mailjets
Send API v3 and v3.1. This package uses [mailjet/mailjet-apiv3-php](https://github.com/mailjet/mailjet-apiv3-php)
library API.

It does **not** try to integrate a Mailjet driver for Swift Mailer
or make use of Mailjets SMTP Relay. It is completely based on Mailjets
Send API.
